# 🌌 Karan’s Planets

An interactive planetary web experience inspired by a Figma prototype and implemented as a modern, single-page website.

This project focuses on translating **design-driven motion and interaction** from Figma into a real, performant web application.

## 🎨 Figma Prototype (Primary Design Reference)

The complete visual design and interaction flow were created in Figma and served as the main reference for this project.

🔗 Figma Prototype:  
https://www.figma.com/proto/gqxBo6HhbB79b6jqon3C3H/karan-s-planets?node-id=1-18&p=f&t=pQXss4Kx1GMWp6dp-0&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=0%3A9

The prototype defines:
- Planet layouts and visual hierarchy  
- Click-based transitions between planetary scenes  
- Rotation-driven motion and smooth scene changes  
- Overall user experience and flow

## 🪐 About the Project

This project recreates the Figma prototype as a real interactive website.  
Instead of embedding the Figma design, all interactions, transitions, and animations are implemented using native web technologies.

Users can click to transition between planets, experiencing smooth rotational motion and scene changes within a fullscreen, single-page interface.
